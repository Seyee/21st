                The story of Nico Manipis de Guzman, Troll, shows how the work of a 
                social media troll affects  his life and identity. The main character 
                works for a company that uses trolls to spread lies and bully people online. 
                To suit the task, he creates three fake characters: Kiko, who is rude and 
                sarcastic Ronnie, who is fun and vulgar and Jessica, who is too weird These fake identities 
                show how she hides behind the “mask,” losing himself he is. He wants to be rich, however 
                feels guilty for conning people into trolls. Making up a story and pretending to be a 
                person else cannot simplest harm ourselves but also can hurt others. 
                It reminds us to be proper to ourselves and now not hurt others for our very own desires. The name 
                teaches us that change starts offevolved within, and we must learn to live authentically. It shows the 
                powerful and now and again unfavorable have an impact on of social media today in the world
