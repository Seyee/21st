            The story of Nico Manipis de Guzman in Troll highlights how the work 
            of a social media troll affects his life and identity. Nico creates fake 
            online personas—Kiko (rude and sarcastic), Ronnie (fun and vulgar), and Jessica 
            (weird)—to carry out his company’s deceitful tasks. These "masks" allow him to 
            hide his true self but ultimately lead to a loss of identity. Despite his 
            desire for wealth, he feels guilt for spreading lies and harming others.

            The narrative emphasizes how pretending to be someone else can damage both 
            oneself and others. It conveys a moral lesson about staying true to oneself
            and avoiding harm for personal gain. The story also critiques the powerful 
            yet destructive influence of social media in today’s world, urging change and 
            authenticity from within.
