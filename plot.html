            <h1>PLOT</h1>

            <pre>
                The story “Troll” was made by Nicko Manipis de Guzman. "It's about an unemployed 
                millennial who applied for a job with an outsourcing firm, only to find out 
                that they hire trolls."This short story is titled Troll because of the Troll 
                of the main character the story revolves around. Shows the cause why they 
                became that way, what the consequences of their deception will be, and 
                what the impact will be on the people they believe in. The characters in 
                the story Kiko, Jessy, and Ronny are the three identities of the main character
                in "Troll." Kiko is snarky and has a foul mouth when talking, Ronny is his 
                conversations, and Jessica is always dramatic. The setting in the story is At 
                TAYO Networking Inc. Main Headquarters, #1 Balimbing Street, WE Development 
                Corporation Village Quezon City house.The conflict in this story is primarily 
                about the person vs. self because the protagonist's opponent/enemy is his 
                ambition to be wealthy, even though he feels terrible for being a media troll. 
                I think that the story is symbolized by a mask because it tells us how one 
                of the characters changed his personality to fit the needs of his job. 
                It's as if he's spent his entire life putting on a mask to pretend to 
                be someone else and forgetting who he really is. The main theme of this story 
                is Life is always full of ways to cope, and a change of lifestyle could be 
                the start of greater things to come. Change begins with you, not with others. 
                You should never pretend to be someone you are not. This story also provides social 
                awareness impact and influence of social media.
