            <h1>Symbolism</h1>
            <pre>
                1.	Facebook and Social Media
                o	Symbolizes a "wardrobe" of identities, reflecting the protagonist's ability to curate and present multiple personas. It mirrors 
                    how social media fosters a fragmented self, allowing individuals to craft masks that may stray far from their authentic selves.

                2.	The TAYO Networking Inc. Headquarters               
                o	The pristine, surreal design of the building, along with its eerie emptiness and decapitated statues, symbolizes the dehumanized, 
                    morally ambiguous nature of the work. It suggests the loss of individuality and the haunting consequences of ethical compromises.
                3.	Decapitated Statues
                o	These represent the suppression of thought, moral accountability, and personal identity. The decapitation is a stark visual of the
                    separation between action and consequence, emphasizing the detachment in the troll’s work.
                
                4.	Personas (Kiko, Jessy, and Romy)
                o	Each persona symbolizes a fragmented piece of the protagonist’s psyche. As these personas develop their own lives, they highlight
                    the protagonist's loss of identity and growing alienation from reality.
                
                5.	The P30,000 Salary
                o	Serves as a symbol of materialism and moral compromise. While it provides short-term fulfillment and access to luxuries, it also 
                    traps the protagonist in a cycle of ethical erosion and existential dissatisfaction.
                
                6.	The Unreliable Technology (Computers, Phones, Gadgets)
                o	The protagonist's reliance on devices that eventually fail or malfunction symbolizes the instability and unsustainability of the
                    life he has built on deception and artificiality.
                
                7.	The Final Reflection in the Screen
                o	The unrecognizable face on the dark computer screen symbolizes the protagonist's complete loss of self-identity. 
                    This moment encapsulates the destructive impact of living multiple fabricated lives and neglecting one’s true identity.
                
                8.	The Pervasive Surveillance (CCTV and Monitoring by TAYO)
                o	Symbolizes the oppressive nature of the system, where even the workers are under constant scrutiny. It reflects 
                    the inescapable grip of social media corporations and the loss of privacy.
                
                9.	Luxury Items and Spending
                o	The protagonist's compulsive shopping for unnecessary items symbolizes an attempt to fill the void caused by moral 
                e   mptiness and identity loss. These are material symbols of his growing disconnection from authentic life values.
                
                10.	The Waiting Room and the Protocol of Silence
                o	Represents the isolating and dehumanizing processes within systems of power, where individuality is irrelevant, and 
                    compliance is paramount.These elements collectively critique societal structures, digital manipulation, and the erosion 
                    of personal morality in pursuit of superficial success.
